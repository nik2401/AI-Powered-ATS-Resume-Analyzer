## 📋 FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>❓ Why is my ATS score low even though I'm qualified?</strong></summary>

ATS systems are keyword-focused. Even highly qualified candidates can score poorly if their resume doesn't use the exact terms from job descriptions. Our tool helps identify these gaps.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>❓ Should I stuff my resume with keywords?</strong></summary>

No! Our analyzer promotes natural integration of relevant keywords. Keyword stuffing is detectable and can hurt your chances with human reviewers.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>❓ How accurate is this compared to real ATS systems?</strong></summary>

Our engine is built on research of major ATS platforms and uses similar algorithms. While 100% accuracy isn't possible (ATS systems vary), we provide a strong approximation of how your resume will be processed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>❓ Can this guarantee I'll get interviews?</strong></summary>

No tool can guarantee interviews, but optimizing for ATS significantly increases your chances of passing initial screening. This gets your resume in front of human reviewers.
